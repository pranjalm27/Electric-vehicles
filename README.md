##India is rapidly embracing electric vehicles (EVs) as a sustainable transportation solution. But India faces unique challenges in managing and recycling EV batteries due to the country's large population, diverse geographical landscapes and the growing demand for electric mobility. There is a need for making sustainable electric vehicle (EV) batteries due to several environmental concerns and regulations. While EVs themselves contribute less pollution compared to conventional vehicles, the manufacturing and disposal processes of EV batteries can have negative environmental impacts. To ensure sustainable practices in the EV industry, 
various regulations and rules have been put in place in India. 
The Environmental Protection Act in India aims to control, prevent, and abate environmental pollution. It sets standards for the discharge of environmental pollutants and demands strict compliance. Non-compliance with the EPA can result in penalties and legal liabilities. The draft Battery Waste Management Rules aim to establish a regulatory framework for safe disposal and recycling of various types of batteries, including lithium-ion batteries used in EVs. The rules propose responsibilities for battery manufacturers, collection centers, and takeback systems. The challenge lies in developing an efficient and sustainable system that can handle the volume of EV batteries, address environmental concerns, and ensure the availability of critical battery materials for
